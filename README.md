# Comparison-Of-Prediction-Models

There are many prediction models in Machine Learning. A forecasting model is determined according to the subject to be estimated in the projects. Sometimes, these prediction models may be stuck between more than one model. In such cases, it is necessary to make comparisons between models in order to determine the most suitable prediction model for our data set.

There are many methods used for comparison operations. In this python file, I covered the analysis of R-square and P-values.
